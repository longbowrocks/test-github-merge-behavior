GitHub PR diffs are based on common ancestor, not line-by-line diff.

This repo will allow me to experiment and find the most maintainable way to have two long-lived branches share *some* changes.

### Latest is trunk, branches are older versions

### Latest is trunk, each version also has a branch (including trunk version)

### Oldest is trunk, new versions get new branches
